# Security Incident Notification Process for SaaS

Security incident notifications will be categorized based on the severity of the incident, ensuring timely and accurate communication while maintaining transparency. This approach enables impacted customers to take required actions.


## Paid Subscriber Notification Process

We will notify customers of any confirmed incident impact within 48 hours of determining that impact.
Timely and comprehensive communication of any security announcements will be sent to subscribers.

## Free Subscriber Notification Process
Free subscribers will be notified on a case-by-case basis upon the determination of WSO2.
## Public Announcement Process

For incidents that affect free-tier users but do not require individual customer action, a public announcement will be made after the necessary fixes have been applied.
