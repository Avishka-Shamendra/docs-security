# Security Incident Notification Process for SaaS

Security incident notifications will be categorized based on the severity of the incident, ensuring timely and accurate communication while maintaining transparency. This approach enables impacted customers to take required actions.


## Paid Subscriber Notification Process

We will notify customers of any confirmed incident impact within 48 hours of determining that impact.
Timely and comprehensive communication of any security announcements will be sent to subscribers.

## Free Subscriber Notification Process

While we ensure the security of our free-tier users, notifications regarding security incidents will only be sent when their applications are directly impacted.

- Free-tier users will receive email notifications of security incidents before they are publicly disclosed, allowing paid customers a required buffer period to take necessary actions.

## Public Announcement Process

For incidents that affect free-tier users but do not require individual customer action, a public announcement will be made after the necessary fixes have been applied.
