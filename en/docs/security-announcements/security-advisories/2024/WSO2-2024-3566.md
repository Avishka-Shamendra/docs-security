### OVERVIEW
Authenticated arbitrary file upload via SOAP admin service.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper validation of user input, a malicious actor could upload an arbitrary file to a user controlled location of the server. By leveraging the arbitrary file upload vulnerability, it is further possible to gain remote code execution on the server. However, malicious actors require admin privileges to exploit this vulnerability

### IMPACT
By leveraging the vulnerability, a malicious actor with admin privileges may perform remote code execution by uploading a specially crafted payload.
