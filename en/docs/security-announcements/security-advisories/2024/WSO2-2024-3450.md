### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.3.0, 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.0, 3.1.0

### OVERVIEW
Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to lack of validation, user supplies data directly pass into the server response of a vulnerable services endpoint, without any sanitization or encoding.

### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible. However, if the service endpoint is not permitted at the gateway level, the impact would be further reduced.

### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix: 

* [https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/pull/13501](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/pull/13501)

In addition, apply the given configuration below to the `_OpenService_.xml` file located in `<APIM_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/synapse-configs/default/api/` if the file does not contain them after the update.

```xml
<inSequence>
