### OVERVIEW
Broken Authentication Vulnerability in REST API Endpoints.


### DESCRIPTION
A malicious actor could manipulate the REST API path and bypass authentication checks relevant to some Rest APIs.

### IMPACT
Considering the most critical REST API endpoint affected by this vulnerability, the successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to impersonate and authenticate as a different targeted user (including an administrator, given the username of the administrator user is known to the malicious actor).


### SOLUTION
We highly recommend to migrate the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
