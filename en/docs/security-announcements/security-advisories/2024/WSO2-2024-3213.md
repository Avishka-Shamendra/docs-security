### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0
* WSO2 Identity Server : 6.1.0, 6.0.0, 5.11.0

### OVERVIEW
APIs can be accessed without the session cookies in the certain condition.


### DESCRIPTION
Given the malicious actor has access to a valid refresh token of an admin user, due to the improper authorization check and token mapping, applicationâ€™s protected APIs can be accessed without the session cookie.

### IMPACT
This behavior could potentially allow a malicious actor to access the API resource if they obtain the refresh token of the admin through any means, especially considering that refresh tokens typically have a longer expiration time compared to access tokens.


### SOLUTION
We highly recommend to migrate the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
