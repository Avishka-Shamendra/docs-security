### OVERVIEW
Unauthenticated Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in SOAP admin services.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the lack of input validation, malicious actors could perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack via SOAP admin services.

### IMPACT
Exploiting this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to access both internal and external resources, available through the network or filesystem. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems, regardless of whether these resources are located within a private network, as long as they are reachable by the WSO2 product.

### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:
