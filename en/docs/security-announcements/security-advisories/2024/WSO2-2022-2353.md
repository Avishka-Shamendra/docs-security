### OVERVIEW
A potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability has been identified in the Publisher Portal.

### DESCRIPTION
An XML External Entity vulnerability was identified in the REST APIs used to add new mediation policies for an API in the Publisher Portal.

### IMPACT
In order to perform the action, a user account with 'publisher' privileges is required. By leveraging the vulnerability, a malicious actor could read confidential files from the file system or access limited HTTP resources that are reachable (over HTTP GET requests) to the vulnerable product. The same vulnerability could be used to perform denial of service attacks by exhausting server resources.

### SOLUTION
We highly recommend to migrate the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
