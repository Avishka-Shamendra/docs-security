### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

The CVE-2022-29464 vulnerability was reported as affecting certain WSO2 components. However, the initial CVE publication[^1] does not contain accurate **Product Status** information, and external advisories, such as the one on NVD[^2], incorrectly identify vulnerable components.

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

### Incorrect External Advisory Information

1. **Incorrect Component Identification:**
   - The information published on external sites like Snyk[^6] incorrectly lists `org.wso2.carbon.identity.auth.rest:org.wso2.carbon.identity.auth.service` as affected, which is incorrect.

2. **Incomplete Version Information:**
   - External advisories, such as NVD, list only the public version (4.7.0) as the patched version for `org.wso2.carbon:org.wso2.carbon.ui` and `org.wso2.carbon:org.wso2.carbon.core.services`. The correct fixed versions include both community and commercial versions, as listed above.

Given these points, the CVE information published on external platforms does not accurately reflect the affected components or the versions that have been patched.

### CONCLUSION

Due to the following key points:

- The incorrect listing of `org.wso2.carbon.identity.auth.rest:org.wso2.carbon.identity.auth.service` as a vulnerable component.
- The omission of commercial patch versions in external advisories.
- The correct identification of affected and fixed versions has not been provided in the original CVE publication [^1].

WSO2 concludes that **this is not an exploitable vulnerability in WSO2 products** if the product versions or the component versions are within the fixed version range, and the vulnerability has already been mitigated as per WSO2-2021-1738[^3].
