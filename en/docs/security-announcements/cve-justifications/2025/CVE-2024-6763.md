### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

The HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI[^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0, 5.11.0, 6.0.0, 6.1.0, 7.0.0, 7.1.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

In Jetty HTTP version 12.0.12 and onwards, this vulnerability has been addressed. However, Jetty HTTP 12.0.x requires Java 17 to support this dependency[^2]. Meanwhile, WSO2 IS versions 5.10.0 to 7.1.0 still support Java versions below 17. Due to these concerns, we are publishing this CVE justification with a detailed analysis of the CVE, outlining how associated risks are mitigated in WSO2 products and the actions WSO2 is taking in response.

Notably, the specific class that could be exploited, HttpURI, is not used within WSO2 Identity Server products.Therefore, we have concluded that this vulnerability does not negatively impact the security  aspect of the WSO2 Identity Server product.
